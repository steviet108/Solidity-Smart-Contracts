# Solidity-Smart-Contracts

![eth_image](Resources/eth_image.png)


Solidity Smart Cortracts that allow joint user's the ability to deposit into a saving's account and withdraw, Trustlessly. This Smart Contract called JointSavings could be deployed onto the Ethereum Blockchain and it would be Immutable. Some functionality in the JointSavings smart contract includes :

- Deposit

- Withdraw

- Check account balance

- Check who was the last to withdraw

- What was the last withdraw amount


## Technologies & Installation

This smart contract was written in Solidity and I used the Remix IDE. There are no installations required to run and interact with the smart contract.


## Usage

This smart contract is written in Solidity and I used the Remix IDE to compile and test functionalities. If the user want to interact with the smart contract it is possible to clone this repository into a local folder and launch the remix IDE here: [remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#optimize=false&runs=200&evmVersion=null&version=soljson-v0.8.7+commit.e28d00a7.js) and then select Solidity as the Environment. Then you can upload the ``` joint_savings.sol ``` file. It will be necessary to compile and deploy before interacting with the smart contract.
